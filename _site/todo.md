#To-Do
* Make the function that populates the divs in the popup and event card generic
* Considering defining some more info about the data in the key object like
  * What kind of data is this? Link / text, etc
  * What to show if it's missing (alternat string)
  * Show it at all if missing?

##Mobile todo
* When you've filtered some results, and pop one up, you can still go side to sdie through ALL ofm, should just be the filtered ones.



##Stuff to put in the prototype clean slate

####JS

* Localstorage handling, so you dont have to get new data all the time if you dont want to
* URL detecting
* Checking for a parameter in the querystring
* Touch checker
* The replaceHistory stuff is pretty nice...
* maybe the data structure populator thingy?

####HTML

* Vieport tag for mobile

####CSS

Include...

* also, not digging client side LESS too much, can we something different?

* Example of an animation syntax
* Example of responsive design query syntax
* Could maybe include it samples / snippets....
* Variables? Not really using these but sure...
